# Project: Compass
Academic Advising web application for the CS department at Azusa Pacific University

Have you ever had problems with signing up for class? It becomes a hassel right? When you’re juggling classes, jobs, relationships, and other heavy responsibilities, the last thing you want to think about are your potential classes for next semester. Even though it may be a pain sometimes, academic advising is the key to success at APU. 

Currently, academic advising takes place in each department with students of each major receiving advising from their respective departments. And right now, students are required to use paper forms to fill out what classes they hope to take in the following semester. Have you ever made an error while filling out these papers? Well you’re not alone! It is common for students to make errors on these forms either spelling wise, or picking classes that they later may not want. This in turn becomes a colossal waste of paper, one of Earth’s most treasured resources. So our software engineering group would like to propose a green alternative to this problem.

We give you "Compass" a web application developed by students, for students! Compass allows you to quickly and seemlessly view your course history and gives advisors the tools they need to properly plan a successful path for their students. Advisors should be a guide to help students throughout their career in college, and Compass gives them the right means to do just that.
